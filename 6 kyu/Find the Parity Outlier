You are given an array (which will have a length of at least 3, but could be very large) containing integers. The array is either entirely comprised of odd integers or entirely comprised of even integers except for a single integer N. Write a method that takes the array as an argument and returns this "outlier" N.

Examples
[2, 4, 0, 100, 4, 11, 2602, 36]
Should return: 11 (the only odd number)

[160, 3, 1719, 19, 11, 13, -21]
Should return: 160 (the only even number)



def find_outlier(integers):
    
    check_lst = []
    
    for i in integers:
        check = i%2
        check_lst.append(check)
    
    total = 0
    total = sum(check_lst)
    
    if total == 1:
        ind = check_lst.index(1)
    else:
        ind = check_lst.index(0)
    
    return integers[ind]
