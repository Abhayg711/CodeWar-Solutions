Write a function, which takes a non-negative integer (seconds) as input and returns the time in a human-readable format (HH:MM:SS)

HH = hours, padded to 2 digits, range: 00 - 99
MM = minutes, padded to 2 digits, range: 00 - 59
SS = seconds, padded to 2 digits, range: 00 - 59
The maximum time never exceeds 359999 (99:59:59)

You can find some examples in the test fixtures.



import pandas as pd
def make_readable(seconds):
    hr, mins = 0,0
    if seconds >= 3600:
        hr = seconds//3600
        seconds = seconds - hr*3600
        if seconds >= 60:
            mins = seconds//60
            seconds = seconds - mins*60
        else:
            pass
    else:
        mins = seconds//60
        seconds = seconds - mins*60
    

    return f"{hr:02d}:{mins:02d}:{seconds:02d}"
