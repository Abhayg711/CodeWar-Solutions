For this challenge you need to create a VIEW. This VIEW is used by a sales store to give out vouches to members who have spent over $1000 in departments that have brought in more than $10000 total ordered by the members id. The VIEW must be called members_approved_for_voucher then you must create a SELECT query using the view.

Tables and relationship below:


resultant table schema
id
name
email
total_spending



create or replace view members_approved_for_voucher as with mbyd as
    (
    select s.department_id, sum(p.price)
      from sales s
      join products p
      on s.product_id = p.id
      group by s.department_id
      having sum(price) > 10000
    )
    
select s.member_id as id, m.name, m.email, sum(p.price) as total_spending
  from sales s
  left join products p
  on s.product_id = p.id
  left join members m
  on s.member_id = m.id
  where s.department_id in (select department_id from mbyd)
  group by s.member_id, m.name, m.email
  having sum(p.price) > 1000
  order by s.member_id;
  
select id, name, email, total_spending from members_approved_for_voucher
